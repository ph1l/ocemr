2) HMIS Reports - we have to make reports on special forms that would
be a lot easier if either (a) a program could generate the report, or
(b) a couple of feature points were added to existing reports.
   Ex. Form 105 - 6 page report - needs:
      - "New or Re-attendance" for each patient seen, then M/F, 0-5y or >5y
      - Then we need to tally for all the diagnoses on their list by
M/F and age 0-5 or >5y
      - some diagnosis aren't on our list but could either be added
for the sake of the reporting, or could existing diagnoses be pulled
into a new generated report?
      - Lab report also needs sex/age and positive results for the report...
      - searching for some diagnoses doesn't give a full list when we
try the diagnosis tally report - For ex. "family planning" -will show
4 out of 6 patients (on one day that I checked), which all carry the
right diagnosis and are even "New" instead of "Follow-up" when I
search them individually from a written list.

Form 033B - weekly reports on 17 major communicable diseases, weekly
attendance, and specifics on malaria testing/treatment.
      - have been starting to keep a paper log of results because
there's no easy way to go back and make the report - needs M/F, age
4m-2y, 3-6y, 7-11y, 12+y, type of test, positive result or not.

Questions:

  - This is a monthly report only? or is there a use in manually specifying a date range? like for getting the yearly numbers or weekly numbers too?

  - These are all just counts, correct? (i.e. number of patient diagnosis per age and sex range?)


Work Items (for you):

  - Please provide an example of the diagnosis searching bug mentioned above.
  Just a Diagnosis and a list of patient ids that should match but don't would
  be super helpful. thanks!

  - Please add the missing diagnoses to the system and provide me a list of
  what you've added.
