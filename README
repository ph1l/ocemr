OCEMR - Open Clinic Electronic Medical Records 
==============================================


Summary
-------

  OCEMR is a web based electronic medical records system designed for the
clinic environment. It is currently in use in the Engeye Health Clinic located
in Ddegeya, Uganda (near Masaka, UG.) When looking into setting up an EMR for
this donation based clinic, all the open-source solutions seemed too heavily
feature-laden to work for our situation so, we built our own. Designed for
small clinics in rural parts of the world, this web-based EMR is portable and
straightforward to use.

- Core Team -

 I would like to thank my brother Joseph Freeman, PharmD, for originally
proposing the idea and pulling me into the loop with the folks at Engeye.
Since graduating pharmacy school, he has been traveling to Africa to
volunteer his time at different charitable organizations. He has been with
the OCEMR project since it's infancy. Together, we have taken the project
from a campfire discussion in the summer of 2010 to live production at the
turn of 2011.

 I would like to thank my fiancee, Carly Gielarowski, for her help and
tireless support throughout this process. Her experience using EMR
programs in the U.S. consumer health care industry was a guiding resource
in the early and middle design stages of the poject. She was also
responsible for the testing and documentation in the final stages of
deployment on-site. She continues to help me as we move the project
forward toward our further goals of making the system more robust
and applicable to other clinic installations.

 I would also like to thank my sister-in-law, Kathy Z. Chang - MD / MPH,
for her help in the late stages of design and implementation on the project.
Her experience as a family practice physician helped to put the finishing
touches on the OCEMR interface design and the Engeye installation.
