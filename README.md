# OCEMR - Open Clinic Electronic Medical Records


## Summary

  OCEMR is a web based electronic medical records system designed for the
clinic environment.  It is currently in use at [The Engeye Health Clinic][s1]
located in Ddegeya, Uganda.  When looking into setting up an EMR for
this donation based clinic, all the open-source solutions seemed too heavily
feature-laden to work for our situation.  So, we built our own!

 OCEMR is designed for small clinics in rural parts of the world, this
web-based EMR intends to be portable and straightforward to use.

## THANKS

### To the Original Team

 I would like to thank Joseph Freeman, PharmD, for originally proposing
the idea and pulling me into the loop with the folks at Engeye.  Since
graduating pharmacy school, he has been traveling to Africa to volunteer
his time at different charitable organizations.  He has been with the
OCEMR project since it's infancy. Together, we have taken the project from
a campfire discussion in the summer of 2010 to live production at the
turn of 2011.

 I would like to thank Carly Gielarowski, for her help and tireless
support throughout this process. Her experience using EMR programs in
the U.S. consumer health care industry was a guiding resource in the
early and middle design stages of the project. She was also responsible
for the testing and documentation in the final stages of deployment
on-site. She continues to help me as we move the project forward toward
our further goals of making the system more robust and applicable to
other clinic installations.

 I would also like to thank my sister-in-law, Kathy Z. Chang - MD / MPH,
for her help in the late stages of design and implementation on the project.
Her experience as a family practice physician helped to put the finishing
touches on the OCEMR interface design and the Engeye installation.


### To the Extended Team

 I would also like to thank the following people for their input and
help with the further design and testing of the system:

	Stephen Po-Chedley, John Kalule, Sarah Yergeau,
	Carlos Elguero, and Stephanie Van Dyke.
